# ScoreKeeper
This project made me to have following skills such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
Using DOM manipulation, EVENTs, plus HTML and some basic CSS and JavaScript wrapping them all together made this pretty simple Ping Pong score keeper widget.
You can select the score what you want to play up to, you can expend the options and select any numbers you want to play up to.
By clicking either "Player One" button or "Player Two" you can easily add a point and you'll see your score changes up there. 
When you reach the score you set, both buttons will be disabled except the RESET button. By clicking the reset button you can restart the game. Try!
